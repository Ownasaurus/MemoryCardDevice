# MemoryCardDevice #

Designed to be built with Code Composer Studio v12
 - Uses Texas Instrument libraries, some of which have been modified
 - Uses FreeRTOS V10.4.6
 - Uses lwip-2.1.3, with an adapted version of TI's lwip port

Initially, Tiva TM4C1294 Launchpad FreeRTOS Demo by @akobyl was used to get started. But then ended up porting the latest versions in myself.

This README should be updated in the near future.

@JLaferri - Designed the memory card device hardware here: https://github.com/JLaferri/HardwareEnhancedMelee/tree/master/Board/TM4C1294/Design/Revision%202. Also created a little thing called project slippi that does the gamecube-side communication....

@ChrisPVille - Help, direction, debugging, advice, and more. this would not have happened without his support.

@altf4 - Lots of testing!
